          Tennis, original name lawn tennis, game in which two opposing players
          (singles) or pairs of players (doubles) use tautly strung rackets to
          hit a ball of specified size, weight, and bounce over a net on a
          rectangular court.Points are awarded to a player or team whenever the
          opponent fails to correctly return the ball within the prescribed
          dimensions of the court. Organized tennis is played according to rules
          sanctioned by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the world
          governing body of the sport.

      <div class="div2">
        <p>
          The invention of modern tennis is disputed, but the officially
          recognized centennial of the game in 1973 commemorated its
          introduction by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield in 1873.Wingfield's
          court was of the hourglass shape and may have developed from
          badminton. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was the governing body of
          real tennis, and in 1875 established a new, standardized set of rules
          for tennis. Mary Outerbridge of New York is credited with bringing a
          set of rackets and balls to her brother, a director of the Staten
          Island Cricket and Baseball Club, but research has shown that William
          Appleton of Nahant, Massachusetts, may have owned the first lawn
          tennis set and that his friends James Dwight and Fred R. Sears
          popularized the game. An important milestone in the history of tennis
          was the decision of the All England Croquet Club to set aside one of
          its lawns at Wimbledon for tennis, which soon proved popular.In 1877,
          a championship subcommittee of three was appointed and decided on a
          rectangular court 78 feet (23.8 metres) long by 27 feet(8.2 metres)
          wide. Twenty-two entries were received, and the first winner of the
          Wimbledon Championships was Spencer Gore. In 1878, the Scottish
          Championships were held,followed in 1879 by the Irish Championships.
          In 1880, the first U.S. championship was held at the Staten Island
          Cricket and Baseball Club, and the victor was an Englishman,
          O.E.Woodhouse. The popularity of the game in the United States and
          frequent doubts about the rules led to the foundation of the USNTA in
          1881, which held the first official US national championship in 1881
          at the Newport Casino, Newport, Rhode Island.Tennis had taken firm
          root in Australia by 1880, and the first Australian Championships were
          played in 1905. In 1886, the first national championships in New
          Zealand were held, and in 1906 the Lawn Tennis Association of
          Australasia (later of Australia) was founded.

      <div class="div3">
        <p>
          The dimensions of the tennis court are 78 by 27 feet for singles and
          78 by 36 feet for doubles, with a net at the centre 3 feet high. The
          most common court materials are clay, cement, and synthetic surfaces.
          The tennis ball consists of a pressurized rubber core covered with
          high-quality cloth, usually wool mixed with up to 35 percent nylon,
          and is changed at regular intervals. The ITF limits racket length for
          professional play to 29 inches (73.7 cm) and maximum racket width is
          12.5 inches (31.75 cm).

      <h3>Principles of play</h3>

      <div class="div4">
        <p>
          Opponents spin a racket or toss a coin to decide on side and service.
          The server serves diagonally across the net and into the opponent's
          right-hand service court. The server is allowed one miss, or "fault,"
          either into the net or outside the opponent's service court. Failure
          to deliver a correct service on two attempts constitutes loss of the
          point. To return service, the receiver strikes the ball back over the
          net and within the boundaries of the opponent's court.After the
          service has been correctly returned, the players may volley the ball
          or hit it after its first bounce, and the point continues until one
          player fails to make a correct return. To win a game, a player must
          win four points and by a margin of two. Zero is referred to as "love"
          and the server's score is called first. If both players reach 40, the
          score is said to be "deuce" and the game continues until a player
          achieves first "advantage" and then the two-point margin for "game."
          There is no limit to the number of times a game can go to deuce before
          it is decided, but in some competitions a so-called "no-ad" system is
          used. Since the early 1970s, tiebreakers have been used to eliminate
          marathon sets.Tiebreakers are usually played at six games all, with
          either an odd number of points with no two-point margin required or an
          even number of points. In major tournaments and the Davis Cup, men and
          women play best-of-five-set matches, while in most other tournaments
          and Olympic competition, all matches are best of three sets. In
          doubles, service alternates between the two opposing teams, but each
          team must decide at the start of each set which partner shall serve
          first. The server will alternate sides of the court on successive
          points in each game, but the receiver will always receive on the same
          side of the court during that game.
