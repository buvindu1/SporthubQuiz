        <h1>Cricket</h1>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch
             with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled 
             at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to
              prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). 
              Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the 
              fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with 
              the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams 
              swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. 
              They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include 
            baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category[2]), golf, hockey, tennis, 
            squash, badminton and table tennis.[3] In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, 
            it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[4] The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three
            "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which
            the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven 
            away from it".</p>

            <p>It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period.
             Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in 
             Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land
             and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford 
             hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he 
             was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c. 1550 by boys in Surrey.The view that it was originally a children's game is 
             reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun "crosse" as "the crooked staff wherewith boys play 
             at cricket" and the verb form "crosser" as "to play at cricket".One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word 
             "cryce" (or "cricc") meaning a crutch or staff. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick".In Old French, 
             the word "criquet" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and 
             the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the 
             time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick (crook).Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word "krickstoel", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling
             in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert 
             of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase").Gillmeister has 
             suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.</p>

             <h2>Playing area</h2>
             <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each.The field is usually circular 
                or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a 
                combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.</P>

               <p>In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket
                is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.[66] The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short 
                grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made 
                of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.</p>
